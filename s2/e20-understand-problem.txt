understand the problem

can i restate the problem in my own words 
what are the inputs that go into the problem
what are the outputs that should come from the solution into the problem 
can the outputs be determined from the inputs, means do we have enough info to solve the problem 
how should i lable the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem 


eg: write a function which takes 2 numbers as a input and returns their sum

can i restate the problem in my own words 
like function that adds two numbers - implement addition

what are the inputs that go into the problem
think what if they send more numbers instead of 2 

what are the outputs that should come from the solution into the problem 
output needs to be in float in case if we get 2 numbers as integers or float......that kind 
what about strings as inputs...

can the outputs be determined from the inputs, means do we have enough info to solve the problem 
in most cases answer is yes 
what happens if someone passed only one number 



how should i lable the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem 
what matters
we have inputs
we have outputs
