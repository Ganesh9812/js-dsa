recursion
different way of writing solutions

why use recursion
a process a function that calls itself
there we will be some end point

why to know this
its everywhere
JSON.parse JSON.stringify
document.getElementById
Object traversal
cleaner alternative to iteration

call stack
when the recursive function calling itself over and over, what happens behind the scenes

anytime a function is invoked it is placed on top of call stack (push)
when js sees return keyword the function ends, the compiler will remove the (pop)

with recursive functions, they keep pushing function over and over onto the callstack and waiting to be called
