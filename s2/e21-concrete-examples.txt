in interview come up with concrete examples
start with simple examples
progress to make complex examples
explore examples with empty inputs
explore examples with invalid inputs

so in interview
write a function which takes a string and return count of each character in the string



example
charCount("aaaa"); // { a: 4}
charCount("hello"); // { h: 1, e:1, l: 2, o: 1}

progess to complex examples 
"my phone number is 334555559"
"Hello hi"

we need to understand problem more before we start on it 

explore examples with empty inputs
charCount("")
what do we want to return in this case 

explore exaple with invalid inputs
what if invalid input like object or numbers are passed instead of string 
we need think of all sort of these edge cases 
understanding the edge cases is important in the real world
