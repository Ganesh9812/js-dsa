if not time, what we should

we can do is count number of simple operations the computer has to perform rather than exact time 

function addUpTo(n){
   const total = n* (n+1)/2;
    return total;
}
here if we take 
here 3 operations * + / happening irrespetive of the n 

here  
function addUpTo(n){
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i<=n; i++){
        total +=i;
    }
    return total;
}

here n operations because if 
n is 10 then + is happening n additions 
and n = assignments 
and i++ here n times this will happen 
no need of going through small operations 
 let total = 0; 1 operation 
 let i = 0; 1 operation 
 i<=n n comparisons so n operations


as n grows the operations increases 

so first solution has 3 operations
so second solution has 5n + 2 operations ~ n
