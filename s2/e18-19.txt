introduction to problem solving

what is an algorithm
process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task 
everything that we do in programming involves some kind of algorithm
its the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer
here we solve the algorithms that can come in interviews

how do we improve here
device a plan for solving problem 
master common problem solving patterns



problem solving strategies
understand the problem
explore concerete examples
break it down 
solve/simplify
look back and refactor


specific blue prints or strategies that we can keeep to solve our problems
